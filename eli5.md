# Explain Like I am Five

![ELI5poster](ELI5.png)

## The Event

Remember when you got a letter for a meeting where you could barely understand its heading?
Or the time when your teacher at higher degree college (yes, "Professor" is not allowed, xP) sent you a paper to read and even the short opening made you go crazy with you having to search up the words?

Well, now is the time to set things straight!

Î¦@I presents to you the our new event **EXPLAIN LIKE I AM FIVE** as part of the Schrodinger's Week 2020.

This is an event where you have to explain fancy topics  using 1000 most commonly used words in English (The words which a five year old can understand!)

The event is inspired by one of our favorite xkcd comics, UP GOER FIVE in which Randall Munroe explains a rocket using the same concept.
