_And yes, this is no usual endeavor. We're spicing things up in this true blend of creativity and science_.

  This category is open to all fields of science. Photos could be of a drosophila larva, colorful array of chemical solutions, or a good old diffraction pattern.

- **Astro:**

  Any astronomy-related photos, ranging from your usual starry night to 14,800ft elevated observatory.

- **People in Science:**

  Showcase the hardworking humans behind the scenes.

- **Computer Generated Media:**

  Ever wondered how you can frame your beautiful graphs, spectra, or microscopic images?
  This category is dedicated to popularizing the important digital components while giving a taste of actual research results.
  Attach a short description of the science behind the images.
