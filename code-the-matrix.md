# Welcome to Code the Matrix!

![hton-poster](hthon-poster.jpeg)

## A hackathon with a twist!

Instead of giving obscure questions that no one will ever use, we explain common methods used in analyzing radio data, simulation methods etc and you, the participant, write the code to implement these, all in a fun, story form.

You can use any language of your choice, but obviously, Python is preferred. You can also use different languages for different questions. And again, only skills learnt in IDC101 are used.

Before starting, **please [register](https://forms.gle/Yd5B49sbfW4U1yub8)**. We will not be able to accept your solutions without you registering.
Each team of **maximum 3 people** needs to register only once.
